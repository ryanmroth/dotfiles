# ryanmroth's dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files for the system and tools I use day-to-day.

**Note**: these dotfiles are for the zsh shell only.

These configurations are designed to work out-of-the-box on MacOS.

## Installation

The dotfiles herein are intended to be used by a Mac Ansible playbook that installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac.
